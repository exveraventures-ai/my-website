# iOS Xcode Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you create the iOS Xcode project from your Next.js app using Capacitor.

## Quick Setup Commands

Run these commands in your terminal (in the project root):

```bash
# 1. Build the Next.js app (creates the 'out' folder with static files)
npm run build

# 2. Add iOS platform (creates 'ios/' folder with Xcode project)
npx cap add ios

# 3. Sync web assets and plugins to iOS project
npx cap sync ios

# 4. Open the project in Xcode
npx cap open ios
```

## What This Creates

After running these commands, you'll have:

```
your-project/
├── app/              # Your Next.js app (unchanged)
├── out/              # Static export (generated by npm run build)
├── ios/              # NEW: iOS Xcode project folder
│   └── App/          # Main iOS app project
│       ├── App.xcodeproj  # Xcode project file
│       └── App/           # Source code and resources
└── capacitor.config.ts
```

## Opening in Xcode

After the setup, you can open the iOS project in Xcode:

**Option 1: From terminal**
```bash
npx cap open ios
```

**Option 2: Manually**
1. Navigate to the `ios/App` folder
2. Double-click `App.xcodeproj`

## Project Configuration

Your Capacitor config (`capacitor.config.ts`) is already set up:
- **App ID**: `com.burnoutiQ.app`
- **App Name**: `Burnout IQ`
- **Web Directory**: `out` (matches Next.js static export)

## First Build in Xcode

1. Open the project in Xcode (see above)
2. Select a simulator or your device from the device menu (top toolbar)
3. Click the "Play" button (▶️) or press `Cmd + R`
4. Wait for the build to complete

## Updating After Code Changes

Whenever you update your Next.js code:

```bash
# 1. Rebuild the Next.js app
npm run build

# 2. Sync changes to iOS
npx cap sync ios

# 3. Rebuild in Xcode (Cmd + R)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If `npx cap add ios` fails:
- Make sure you have Xcode installed
- Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
- Make sure CocoaPods is installed (usually auto-installed by Capacitor)

### If build fails in Xcode:
- Make sure you've selected a signing team in Xcode (Settings → Signing & Capabilities)
- Clean build folder: `Product → Clean Build Folder` in Xcode
- Rebuild: `npm run build && npx cap sync ios`

### If Capacitor plugins aren't working:
- Make sure you've run `npx cap sync ios` after installing new plugins
- Restart Xcode after syncing
